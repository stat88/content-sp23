    "## 1. Airlifting Rhinos ##\n",
    "\n",
    "Poaching is a real threat to rhinoceroses in southern Africa. So, governments and NGOs in the region often relocate the rhinos to protect them. However, relocating them by road is often impractical, so they sometimes airlift them by tying up their feet and suspending them from underneath a helicopter (after tranquilizing them, of course). There was an academic paper to test how this activity affected the rhinos' health ([The Pulmonary and Metabolic Effects of Suspension by the Feet Compared with Lateral Recumbency in Immobilized Black Rhinoceroses Captured by Aerial Darting](https://meridian.allenpress.com/jwd/article/57/2/357/451340/THE-PULMONARY-AND-METABOLIC-EFFECTS-OF-SUSPENSION)). Check out the pictures, they are quite wild (pun not intended).\n",
    "\n",
    "**a)** One important thing to test is how well they are breathing when suspended by the feet--scientists can check their mean breathing rate. Obviously, the true mean breathing rate $\\mu$ for rhinos as a species is unknown. In the sample of this study, the rhinos had a mean breathing rate of $5.6$ breaths/minute with a standard deviation of $1.2$ breaths per minute. Suppose, for this question, that the sample size was 100 rhinos. Construct a 95% confidence interval for the underlying mean $\\mu$.\n",
    "\n",
    "**b)** Do the data indicate that $\\mu = 5$ breaths/minute?"
